# Challenge Specifics

```md
Input:
A floating-point number representing an amount of money in dollars. The input value will always be greater than 0 and up to two decimal places.

Output:
The program should output the equivalent amount in coins, displaying the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies needed. The output should be formatted as follows:
Quarters: [number]
Dimes: [number]
Nickels: [number]
Pennies: [number]

Requirements:
Efficiency: Your solution should use the least number of coins possible.
Accuracy: The total value of the coins should exactly match the input amount in dollars.
Input Validation: Ensure the program handles invalid inputs gracefully, such as negative numbers or non-numeric values, by displaying an appropriate message.
Display Format: Clearly and neatly output the coin breakdown, ensuring readability.

Example:
Input (represents dollars): 4.99
Output:
Quarters: 19
Dimes: 2
Nickels: 0
Pennies: 4

For you non-americans/weirdos:
Quarter = $0.25, Dime = $0.10, Nickel = $0.05, Penny = $0.01
```
